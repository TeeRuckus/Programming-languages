I am going to have some back up code in here just in case my other doesn't work for here
    -- going through the whole enitre array, and this is going to be the cursor
    -- which is going to be infront
    for ii in size loop
        Put_Line ("Hello world");
        --this is going to be the cursor which is going to be behind and doin
        --the comparison for the sorting algorithm
        for jj  in size loop
            Put_Line("lagging begind the programme");
        end loop;

    end loop;
    New_Line;
