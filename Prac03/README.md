###HOW TO RUN
    this project is going to contain **run.sh** script. Therefore, all the marker
    has to do is to type in the command **run.sh** to run the approrpiate 
    programme

###FILES IN PROJECT: 
    fizzBuzz.adb: 
        algo60 implementation of the fizz buzz programme

###TESTING METHOD:
    The a hard coded array of descending numbers had being progreammed in the 
    algorithm, an array of descending numbers have being choosen as they're 
    typically goin to be the harder arrays to sort for sorting algorithms.
    Therofore, that hard coded array is inputted into the bubble sort algorithm,
    and the results are going to be observed out of the terminal of the programme.
    Therefore, the programme is functional if it's going to output an array in
    ascending order.
