	abstract = {The overall damping of linear arch dam–water–foundation rock systems depends on the material damping of dam concrete, material and radiation damping of semi-unbounded foundation rock, and the dam–water interaction. The effective damping ratio of these factors is separately evaluated for the Mauvoisin arch dam in Switzerland to quantitatively discuss their contributions, and to guide the damping selection in numerical analysis. A further aim is to investigate whether the material and radiation damping of the foundation rock can be replaced by increasing the material damping of the dam to simplify numerical analysis models. The seismic responses of the Mauvoisin arch dam are analyzed using semi-unbounded and massless foundation models. The overall effective damping ratio of the system can be approximately expressed as the summation of the individual effective damping; therefore, the increased material damping of the dam can approximate the material and radiation damping of the semi-unbounded foundation rock.}
